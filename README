To run this properly, you will need to compile Assign2.java, and run it giving it a test file as a CLI argument.

1) javac Assign2.java
2) java Assign2 Tests/Test6.scala

Should you want to examine the output in another fashion than in the terminal, and you are on a linux machine, try 

3) java Assign2 Tests/Test6.scala > [output file name]

I have included all the original test files, as well as my Test6 output.
