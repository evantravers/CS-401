To run the interpreter, run "java Driver < Tests/Test[1-6]". It will spit out the last store of the main, and the outfile generated by the println statements in the code. I have included a results.txt file that has the output of all six of the files. All sources, tests files, and outputs are included in this folder.
Works great!
